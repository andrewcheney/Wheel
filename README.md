# Wheel
This website spins a wheel, outputting a random given choice. To change the possible outputs add "?options=" to the end of the URL and put the options you want there separated by commas. 
Examples: 
https://andrewcheney.github.io/Wheel/?options=Dog,Cat,Fish
https://andrewcheney.github.io/Wheel/?options=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17
You can also use "_" as well instead of spaces.
