# Wheel
You can use https://andrewcheney.github.io/Wheel/create.html to create the wheels or follow the instructions below.

This website spins a wheel upon loading, displaying a random given choice. To change the possible outputs add "?options=" to the end of the URL and put the options you want there separated by commas. 
Examples: 

https://andrewcheney.github.io/Wheel/

https://andrewcheney.github.io/Wheel/?options=Dog,Cat,Fish

https://andrewcheney.github.io/Wheel/?options=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17

You can use "_" as well instead of spaces.
https://andrewcheney.github.io/Wheel/?options=The_Earth,The_Sun,The_Moon

You can also add themese to the wheel, by adding "?theme=" to the end of the url (after the options). By putting in a list of hexcodes seperated by commas you can add custom colors (just make sure the hex codes don't have #, use "fff" not "#fff").
Examples:
https://andrewcheney.github.io/Wheel/?options=Dog,Cat,Fish?theme=f05d5e,0f7173,e7ecef,272932,d8a47f
